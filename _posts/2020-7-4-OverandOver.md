"Distance does not kill relationship. But Silence does." or Maybe silence is the best answer. 
As one does not have any feelings for you, he will not talk to you. Yup. I think that's the end of our relationship.
Shortly Mr. üç® has become a past tense of my life. 
But for this time, I didn't even feel so sad but more doubtful about my efforts to end this single life.
Being single is not a bad choice. But feeling miserable about the single life is. 
Let the long-lasting silence finish our short-lived romance. And I shall start afresh into the uncertainty of life.
